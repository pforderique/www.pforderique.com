Optimized for low latency by parallelizing per-stock execution with multithreading (C++, SQLite). Simulated the complete market workflow, including a TCP exchange server, a UDP transaction recorder with an HTTP API for historical prices, and a terminal UI for real-time quotes and chart upyears (C++, Python, Docker).",
